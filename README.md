In this repo we set up kubeflow via terraform,
so that we can easily set up and tear down a kubeflow cluster 
for short-term experimentation.

## Pre-requisistes

1. Terraform
2. A google cloud project
3. Install the Cloud SDK: The Cloud SDK provides the command-line
   tools you'll need to deploy and manage Kubeflow. Install it by 
   following the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
